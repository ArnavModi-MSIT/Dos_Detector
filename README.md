🚀 Features

    ✅ Multi-layered Detection: Monitors attacks across Network, Internet, Transport, and Application layers

    📡 Real-Time Monitoring: Live packet inspection and attack detection

    🧠 Hybrid Analysis: Combines rule-based signatures with ML-based classification

    🗂️ Structured Logging: Stores detections in clean, CSV-formatted logs

    🧩 Modular Design: Independent detection modules for each layer

    📶 Wi-Fi Support: Specialized detection for wireless-specific attacks

    ⚡ Lightweight: Optimized for low overhead and fast packet processing

🔍 Detection Modules

Each layer has a dedicated detection script designed to catch specific threats:
1. Network Layer (network_layer_detection.py)

    ARP Spoofing

    Deauthentication Attacks

    Evil Twin Access Points

    MAC Flooding

2. Internet Layer (internet_layer_detection.py)

    IP Spoofing

    Ping Flooding

    Port Scanning

3. Transport Layer (transport_layer_detection.py)

    SYN Flood

    RST Flood

    UDP Flood

    Connection Flood

    TCP Port Scan

4. Application Layer (application_layer_detection.py)

    DNS Spoofing

    DNS Tunneling

    SQL Injection

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

    SSL Stripping

    Credential Theft

5. Analyzer (analyser.py)

    Real-time ML-based predictions

    Rule-based fallback detection

    Custom model support (combined_rf_model.pkl)

    Dual-mode analysis (offline/online)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
🔧 Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    Linux (recommended: Kali Linux or Ubuntu)

    Root privileges (sudo)

    Wireless card supporting monitor mode

    Minimum 4GB RAM recommended

📦 Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-detection.git
cd network-security-detection

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

📡 Enable Monitor Mode

sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

🔧 Configuration

Edit each detection script to:

    Set your monitoring interface (e.g., wlan0mon)

    Add target MAC/IP filters if needed

    Adjust thresholds and detection rules as needed

🧪 Usage
🎮 Basic Commands

sudo python3 network_layer_detection.py
sudo python3 internet_layer_detection.py
sudo python3 transport_layer_detection.py
sudo python3 application_layer_detection.py
sudo python3 analyser.py

🧭 Run in Background

nohup sudo python3 analyser.py > detection.log 2>&1 &

📁 Output

All detection modules output CSV files for post-analysis and logging:

    network_layer_attacks.csv

    internet_layer_attacks.csv

    transport_layer_attacks.csv

    application_layer_attacks.csv

    combined_analysis_report.csv (from analyser)

Models and encoders are saved in:

    combined_rf_model.pkl

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Permission denied	Run with sudo
Interface not found	Use iwconfig to confirm interface name
No packets captured	Ensure monitor mode is active
ML model error	Retrain model using model_trainer.py
Dependency errors	Reinstall using pip install -r requirements.txt
